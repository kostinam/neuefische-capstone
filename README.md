# Your Plate, Your Planet: Understanding the Greenhouse Gas Impact of Our Food Choices

## Overview
This is a project created as a part of a 3-month Data Analytics program at [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/en/bootcamp/data-analytics). 
This repository contains the culmination of three months of learning and hands-on experience in a data analytics bootcamp. The project focuses on applying data analysis and visualisation skills to solve real-world problems, utilizing various tools and techniques learned during the program.

The data used in this project is available on the [website](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/) of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). 


## Project Description
**Objective:** This project investigates the relationship between global food production and its corresponding greenhouse gas emissions, with a primary goal of identifying and highlighting high-emission foods. We use the data from the FAO, examining worldwide trends as well as the data specific for Germany.

**Tools and Technologies:** Python, SQL, Jupyter Notebooks
